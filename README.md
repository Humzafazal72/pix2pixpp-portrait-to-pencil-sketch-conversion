A PyTorch implementation of **pix2pix++**, a GAN-based framework for converting portrait images into realistic pencil sketches. This project enhances the original pix2pix architecture by integrating a U-Net++ generator to capture richer contextual information and produce fine-grained sketch details.

## üñãÔ∏è Overview

This repository contains:

- An improved **pix2pix++** model architecture for image-to-image translation.
- A dataset of portrait/sketch pairs created using a mobile app and preprocessed for training.
- Training and evaluation scripts to replicate and extend our results.

This work was part of a research study aiming to generate pencil sketches that preserve the artistic quality and structure of input portraits.
